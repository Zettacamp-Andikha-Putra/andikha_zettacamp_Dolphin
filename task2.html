                    The Pokémon Trading Card Game is a strategy-based card game that is usually played on a designated playmat where two players
                    (assuming the role of Pokémon Trainer) use their Pokémon to battle each other. Each player puts one Pokémon into play as their Active Pokémon
                    and attacks their opponent's Active Pokémon. A Pokémon that has sustained enough damage from attacks–that reaches or exceeds its HP–is referred to
                    as being "Knocked Out".
