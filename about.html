            <h4>PT Tokopedia</h4>
            <p>PT Tokopedia is an Indonesian e-commerce company.
                Tokopedia is a subsidiary of a new holding company called GoTo, following a merger with Gojek on 17 May 2021.
                It is one of the most visited e-commerce platforms in Indonesia.
                Tokopedia is one of Indonesia's unicorn companies, alongside Bukalapak, Gojek, OVO, and Traveloka.
                As of December 2020, Tokopedia claims to have more than 350 million product listings and 42 digital products,
                and serves over 100 million monthly active users as well as over 9.7 million merchants on its platform.

            <h4>History</h4>
            <p>
                William Tanuwijaya and Leontinus Alpha Edison came up with the idea for Tokopedia in 2007.
                While reflecting on his childhood experience, Tanuwijaya realized that access to products such as books differed between small towns and big cities,
                and that technology could provide better access to products.
                The duo launched Tokopedia two years later with starting capital from an acquaintance.

            <p>
                Toko is Indonesian for "shop", and is the first half of the portmanteau of the company's name, concatenated with "encyclopedia".
                The choice of this designation is to reflect their objective of becoming an all-encompassing marketplace for Indonesians.
                Tokopedia has since expanded its business to cover the fintech, payments, logistics, and retail sectors.

                Since 2017, Tokopedia's office resides in a 53-floor building called the Tokopedia Tower,
                located in the central business district of Jakarta.

                As of 2018, it is claimed that Tokopedia's products and services are accessible in 93% of sub-districts across Indonesia.

                In March 2023, Tokopedia announced its new management structure with Melissa Siska Juminto appointed as President of E-Commerce for Tokopedia and Director/Chief Human Resources Officer for GoTo.
                Melissa was previously the COO of Tokopedia since 2018.
